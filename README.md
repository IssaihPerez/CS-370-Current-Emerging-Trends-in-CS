# CS-370-Current-Emerging-Trends-in-CS

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
For the Final Project, I was given the initial code that helped define the 'Maze' Environment as well as all of the different actions the Intelligent Agent could take. The code I developed was the Main Loop function, which specified the Agents exploration or exploitation within the Maze environment, as well as the win rate and the 'learning curve'. I also added some utility code to help keep track of the time the code took to run each different test.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
  What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
  Computer Scientists analyze and help solve complex problems that we would have within the world. Their work is     extremely important as it can help promote new technological advances or drive new innovation with our current technologies to help solve further complicated problems
  How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
  For me, I personally look at the problem and try and break it down into easy to digest components and see how I can work on fixing or improving the issues piece by piece. This method allows me to look at individual pieces of the puzzle and formulate how they can all connect without getting overwhelmed at the bigger picture. 
  What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
  My ethical responsibilities helps hold me accountable in the ways I can collect and manage my research data, as well as how I utilize my data for my reseach/study purposes. My goal is to create work that helps protect user(s) data and doesn't aim to utilize their personal information for my own personal gain.
